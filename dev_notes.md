Prompt:Create a professional-looking website utilizing HTML, CSS, and basic coding. I need this website to have 5 pages available for users to click on using a navigation bar. A homepage (index.html) with a title, header, and a little bit about me. (Description of me can be: "I am Matthew, a graduate student at the Kelley School of Business studying Information Systems. I enjoy playing and watching hockey as it has been my favorite sport for my entire life. I also love getting the chance to do physical activities to stay active and being with friends and family") In this page, I want navigation links (that will be present on every page at the top) to be "About Me", "Resume","Projects","Contact". The next page will be the About Me page(About.html) This will include a detailed biography about me. (Here is the biography: I am a graduate student at Indiana University Kelley School of Business studying Information Systems. I did my undergrade here as well, getting a bachelor's in Information Systems and a minor in Economics. I am originally from South Bend, Indiana (by Notre Dame) and went to Penn High School.

I love being able to identify loopholes or issues with current cybersecurity principles and finding ways to address those issues. I enjoy learning about different cybersecurity concepts related to cryptography. I also am interested network architectures. More specifically, how a network in a company is built and maintained. I enjoy the hardware aspects of these systems and how they operate together. Goals (list): Become a cybersecurity consultant, Become a high-level IT manager in a  large company, Become a CIO. The next page will be Resume (resume.html). In this page, display my resume which is titled "Laware_Matthew_Resume.pdf". Next is Projects (projects.html) Show the Project1.png file. After this, provide a description of it stating "This project involved the creation of an employee management system with python and sql databases. It allowed me to create new employees, edit existing employees, delete employees, and display all employees. Using numbers 1-5 I could pick whatever option required and enter informaiton relating to a specific employee or new hire. This project improved my ability to connect a database to python code and make it functional." After this, provide this link for the file in its own section: @https://github.com/mlaware/9-26-InClass.git . Next, do the same with project2.png. Put the image, then enter this description: "This project was enabled using AI resources. It involved definining website capabilities that I wanted for users to have and created a realistic prototype that is functioning. It allows users to click on different aspects on the home page, which redirects users to booking appointsments, checking-in, viewing medical records, and confirming insurance costs." Then, after the description, on its own line, here is the link to it: @https://health-nav-d2129f19.base44.app/ . For the final page, Contact (contact.html), this will include my contact info, in the form of links. At the top, under the navigation, create 3 professional-looking links that are based on these 3 links I provide: mlaware@iu.edu, @https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewlaware/ , @https://github.com/mlaware . Below these 3 links, create a FORM that has the following fields and permissions: First Name(required), Last Name(required), Email Address(required, valid format necessary), Password(requires 8 characters minimum, required), Confirm Password(required, this must match password entry). Use the attributes required, type, pattern, and minlength. Also, show clear error messages when invalid inputs are created, using HTML. Lastly, redirect users to a Thank You page (thankyou.html) when the submission is entered successfully. Accessibility requirement: All inputs must have labels connected with for and id. Add alt text for any images.
Output: AI created a very professional website with common colors and styles. It used all the information, images, and text that I provided to create many navigation tabs in the nav. It had no problem producing every html file and creating a separate styles.css that is comprehensive of all the styles present among all the html files. Also, it automatically made it adapt to phone screens if necessary.
I accepted all of the code it presented.

Prompt: Adjust the code as necessary, I moved the images into a subfolder. Also, the MattImage.jfif needs to be displayed in the About Me html file.
Output: Adjusted the image locations in each html file to match the folder that I had created and put all images into. Also it added the About me image that I had forgot to add in the first iteration.
I accepted all of the code it presented.

Prompt: The email button on the contacts page does not lead me to anything, the best option would be to display the actual email so people can copy and paste it if necessary. Make this happen but maintain the professional look.
Response: Created a copyable box with my email in it as well as a button that allows you to auto-copy it to clipboard. Kept the professional feel and spacing the same with the links that actually work below it.
I accepted all of the code it presented.

Reflection:
AI really improved the efficiency at which I was able to complete this assignment. After spending a considerable amount of time on the original prompt itself, AI was able to digest the information and provide a comprehensive output that covered almost all of the requirements that I outlined for the website. The only mistakes that AI made were regarding links working properly. It struggled to make all of them "clickable" but beyond this, it made very few mistakes. AI did most of the heavy-lifting regarding the creation of the files but I tested all functionality on the actual website, while also double checking the underlying code to ensure that I could understand what was being created.
