                    <h3>Interests</h3>
                    <p>Regarding my major, one of my biggest interests is cybersecurity. I love being able to identify loopholes or issues with current cybersecurity principles and finding ways to address those issues. I enjoy learning about different cybersecurity concepts related to cryptography. I also am interested network architectures. More specifically, how a network in a company is built and maintained. I enjoy the hardware aspects of these systems and how they operate together.</p>
